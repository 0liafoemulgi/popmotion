# Redshift

## Anything in, anywhere out

Redshift is a JavaScript UX framework for animation, interaction and physics. It works with pure numbers and outputs directly to your custom callbacks.

**Key benefits of this approach:**

* Use your any technology or framework (DOM, jQuery, Canvas, WebGL, etc)
* Animate any numerical property, without waiting for us to support it
* We never hit the DOM, leaving you in total control of performance
* Unlock the power of easing, for any purpose


**More features:**

* Seamlessly hand-off between user input, animation and physics simulations
* Create custom easing bezier curves
* Create custom inputs to experiment with new input devices
* Uses our [Cycl](https://github.com/InventingWithMonster/cycl) unified requestAnimationFrame process manager for high performance
