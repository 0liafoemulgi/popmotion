# Redshift

## Anything in, anywhere out

Redshift is a JavaScript UX framework for creating animations and physics-based user interactions. It provides CSS support for ease-of-use but provides the ability to work with raw numbers and custom callbacks for total creative freedom.

**Flexible**
* Work with your favourite technology or framework (DOM, jQuery, Canvas, Three.js etc)
* We never hit the DOM, leaving you in total control of performance
* Animate any property without waiting for explicit support
* Seamless hand-off between user input, animation and physics

**Extendable**
* Create custom Input handlers for Oculus/Leap/anything
* Add custom easing bezier curves
* Expand our native DOM attr and CSS support with your own custom "routes"
