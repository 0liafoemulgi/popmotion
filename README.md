# Redshift

## Anything in, anywhere out

Redshift is a JavaScript UX framework. It can be used for animations, UI physics, and input tracking.

It provides DOM support for ease-of-use but provides the ability to work with raw numbers and custom callbacks for total creative freedom. On the web, on the server, anywhere.

### Flexible
* Animate any property without waiting for explicit support via custom callbacks.
* Seamless hand-off between user input, animation and physics.
* Work with your favourite technology or framework (DOM, Node, jQuery, Canvas, Three.js, WebSockets etc).

### Extendable
#### Develop your own:
* **Easing:** Easing functions and bezier curves.
* **Physics:** Add new physics simulators.
* **Element types:** Handle different types of element (DOM, Canvas shapes etc) with the same API.
* **Value types:** Automatically split special values in child values (ie `"#000"` -> `{ Red: 0, Green: 0, Blue: 0, Alpha: 1 }`.
* **Input:** Create custom Input interfaces for Oculus/Leap/anything.
* **Value routes:** Output values of a certain type (ie attr, css) in a standardised way.

### Peformant
* Uses and exposes a single requestAnimationFrame thread.
* Never hits the DOM, leaving you in total control of performance.
* Over **20% smaller** than Velocity.js, **72% smaller** than GreenSock TweenMax. Boom shak shakalaka.
